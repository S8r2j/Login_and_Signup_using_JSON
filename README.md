# Login_and_Signup_using_JSON
> This project is based on the CRUD operation of the data in JSONPOWERDB. It is one of the most satisfying tools for the web page. In this project I have made a login and signup page to create and store data taken from user in JSONPOWERDB and to retrieve data from it as well. This is the best tool I have ever used. It has made simple and easy for developers to formulate the user's data.
